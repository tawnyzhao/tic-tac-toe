# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using React

## Overview
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is based off of the [tutorial found on the React website.](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) <br>
The extra improvements reccomended at the end of the tutorial are also implemented. This includes: <br>

* Displaying the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bolding the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewriting Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Adding a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlighting the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, displaying a message about the result being a draw.

This was created for educational purposes. Feel free to leave any feedback on the project with an issue.
